# ScrapingHydrodaten

I'm a passionate surfer. In Switzerland we have a famous riverwave in Bremgarten. This wave only works on certain waterlevels. I want to be informed with an e-mail as soon as the correct waterlevel is reached. In this project a scrape the necessary information from the offical swiss website http://hydrodaten.admin.ch.
